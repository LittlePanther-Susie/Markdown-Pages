# Notebook-Publish
This repository is to publish posts as an alternative to a blog. I created a blog powered by Github pages with Jekyll, but it was a bit time-consuming and sometimes annoying to maintain it. So, I've just decided to create my posts on Google CoLab and publish them in Github repository.
